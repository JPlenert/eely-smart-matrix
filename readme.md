# eely-Smart-Matrix

ESP-IDF component library for HUB75 displays.

Derived from the https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix project for exclusive usage for the ESP32 microcontroller for my eely (https://eely.eu) projects.

## Remark

This a private hobbyist (aka maker) project that helps me to ['sharpen the saw'](https://blog.codinghorror.com/sharpening-the-saw/) as a Director of a Software innovation unit.
